Some projecteuler.net solved problems

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.

Wanting to (re)learn Haskell and (re)learn a lot of high-school math that I used to know, I started doing some math problems. 
Haskell seems like a great language especially for the math problems on project euler, which requires programming to get an optimal solution.
