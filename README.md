Haskell solutions for the first 10 problems on projecteuler.net

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

Wanting to (re)learn Haskell and (re)learn a lot of high-school math that I used to know, I started doing some math problems. 
Haskell seems like a great language especially for the math problems on project euler, which requires programming to get an optimal solution.
